        <p> Throughout the four years I've been coding I've developed many tools to help me along the way. Some of these
            were built after researching math online, others through trial and error. I've even developed some tools to
            help me with school projects! (check out my Physics Sign Proposal Project)</p>

                    points and lines, and
                    angles. The Particles file contains my entire particle system, including basic particles, physics
                    particles, shockwaves,
                    sparks, homing bullets, and torches (that contain embers and can emit particles that give off
                    light). The Network file
                    contains my implementation of a neural network and all its supporting classes like activation
                    functions and their
                    derivatives. The Text file contains code for displaying text in practically every way possible (can
                    set font weights,
                    sizes, auto-wrapping, shadows, blurred shadows, centered text, and more). I could keep going on and
                    on, but you get the
                    point. This has everything important and useful.

                <div class="project-card-desc">Part of applying to MIT's Summer Beaverworks program was completing many
                    coding projects. One of my favorites was
                    developing a PID controller (which stands for Proportional, Integral, and Derivative, for the three
                    components that act
                    to reduce error as efficiently as possible). I would later use this at UTD in my final project
                    involving a badminton
                    retrieval drone (see the Machine Learning/Algorithms section for more). To get a better
                    understanding of the math after
                    coding it I created a visual using a car that was controlled by my PID controller to stay on a sin
                    wave track.

                    the year we had a project where the winner would
                    win extra credit. The goal was to find the optimal design for holding up a sign. The inputs were the
                    size/weight/cost of
                    the sign, the strength/length/cost of the rope holding it, and the angle at which the rope would be
                    held. Of course,
                    wanting that extra credit and knowing I could write a program to solve it for me, I decided to code
                    a program that would
                    let me quickly test every possible combination and find the best solution.
