        <p>Game Dev is how I began coding. One of my biggest inspirations online was the youtube channel
            @DaFluffyPotato—I learned most of my skills from Youtube and through trial and error. All of these were
            created using Python, and they used Pygame as their interface.</p>

                <div class="project-card-desc">My most recent game, but very much a work in progress so far. I used my
                    boid algorithm for boss movement around walls. I
                    also created an ellipse collision function for a “Casket Toss” attack by the ranged boss. Finally, I
                    used a Calculus BC principle called a "Geometric Series" to calculate the initial speed the casket
                    should be thrown at and how quickly this speed should decay. This ensures the casket lands at the
                    player's position every time while following a believable, decaying parabolic path to get there.
                    Melee boss and better graphics coming soon!

                    Tanks, and thought “hey, I could make that.” A
                    few hours later I had a simple 2D tile-based game with a sentry that could automatically target the
                    player and health
                    boxes that would spawn randomly. While it was quite a simple game, the biggest achievement was
                    building something
                    cohesive and (mostly) bugless it in only a few hours.

                    Originally this was a project to build a BFS/DFS based Tic-Tac-Toe bot for the 8-week AI course I
                    was attending at UTD. After quickly finishing that and having copious amounts of time left, I
                    thought why not make the controller cooler. A few hours of debugging later I was left with an OpenCV
                    model that could detect my hand using my laptop's camera to let me play TicTacToe against a custom
                    BFS bot! Using OpenCV's hand detection model, I created a mouse pointer that is located between the
                    user's index finger and thumb. To click, the user has to pinch their fingers in a similar way to
                    Apple's recent "Apple Vision Pro" product.</div>
