                <div class="project-card-desc">On Sebastian Lague's youtube channel I found a really cool looking
                    triangle tesselation background and wanted to see if I could code it myself. After spending an hour
                    or so researching Delaunay Triangulation I coded my own implementation of it and began experimenting
                    with color combinations and other ways to make it look even more interesting. Another super cool
                    fact I found about Delaunay Triangulation is that it can be used to generate Voronoi Diagrams by
                    connecting the centers of the circumcircles of each triangle.

                    developing the atmosphere and graphics for the game.
                    This was my first time building a dual-screen system in Pygame. Later in the project I also
                    attempted to use noise
                    textures to generate custom maps so the game could be a rogue-like rather than a two-player combat
                    game; I successfully
                    made a program that interpreted premade images of noise into a tile map but wasn't able to write a
                    program that could
                    efficiently generate Perlin noise images.

                <div class="project-card-desc">Using new particle classes I wrote for my CSP Project (look in the games
                    section), I decided to make an explosion graphic. The color palette and general design of the
                    explosion was based on DaFluffyPotato's game “Explon't.” Watch his video here:

                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cgjYlH2g9g">Youtube Link</a></span>. One thing I've
                    noticed is that the particles clump up at tile boundaries; this is why the smoke appears to be in
                    vertical lines rather than uniformly spread out. At the time I didn't know how to solve this, but
                    I've fixed it in recent particle class iterations by splitting the vertical and horizontal collision
                    checks. I left the older particle class version in this video demo to show how I've improved!
