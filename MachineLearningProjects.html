        <p>Since March, 2023, I've developed many algorithms involving Searches, Clustering, Cellular Autamata, and
            Tilemaps. Since the Summer of 2023 when I attended UTD's 8-week AI course and learned about many machine
            learning principles, I've built machine learning projects using Computer Vision, Genetics-based
            Evolution, and Reinforcement Learning.</p>

                    It's not heavily optimized but it still runs quite quickly and can fill a ~8000 tile section in a
                    few seconds. (A lot of lag towards the end of the fill demo is purely because of computation lag
                    from the visuals. I'm manually drawing the thousands of filled tiles each frame which slows down the
                    program a lot).

                    Summer Course, which I attended the summer following my Sophomore year. For my final
                    project at the UTD course, I attempted to create a drone that could follow badminton shuttles,
                    catch them, and retrieve them back to the user. This would require many steps, the first of which
                    being detecting the shuttle. I started with collecting data by manually annotating 700 images of
                    shuttles that I collected by sampling videos I recorded on my phone. I then used Roboflow's
                    augmentation software to apply random rotations, recoloring, and noise to the images and was left
                    with ~16,000 images. I then created a CNN model (Convolutional Neural Network) that could detect
                    badminton shuttles within an image by using transfer learning to convert the YoloV8 object detection
                    model to detect badminton shuttles in my image data. The next step was implementing a controller
                    that would use the position data of the shuttle from the CNN model to move the drone. I couldn't
                    directly enter lateral positions because the only parameter of the drone I could control was its
                    acceleration by tilting the drone. The solution was a tuned PID controller. Using a custom
                    bi-directional PID controller (shown in the background photo), I could move the drone towards the
                    shuttle without major oscillations. Thefinal step was returning the drone back to the user. To do
                    this, I simply recorded positon movements of the drone as it followed the shuttle and calculated a
                    return path to reach the starting position. While I wasn't able to finish the physical drone in
                    time
                    for the presentation, the model and software required to create the drone were completed in time.

                    learning how to code discrete reinforcement learning
                    using my own implementation of a neural network in a tile-based environment. The agent has to learn
                    to reach the goal in
                    a minimum number of steps while avoiding running into obstacles. Completing this project taught me
                    about the Monte Carlo
                    method, the SARSA algorithm(State_knot, Action, Reward, State_next, Action_next), and q-learning. I
                    would eventually get
                    selected as an (informal) TA during the last few weeks of the course to teach other students about
                    reinforcement
                    learning and specifically q-learning. Eventually, I'd also dive into actor-critic models using my

                    Summer Course, which I attended the summer following my Sophomore year. This used a
                    tree data structure to sort a dataset of ~8000
                    mushrooms based on specific attributes and the Naive Bayes algorithm. After implementing that,
                    though, I wanted to
                    create a visual so I could better understand the algorithm and the final product it produced, so I
                    coded this! (the
                    spacing is a little wack so some nodes aren't the most legible)

                    Summer Course, which I attended the summer following my Sophomore year. This was
                    around a week before we would learn neural
                    networks, so this model was only made with four weight parameters. The bulk of this project was just
                    understanding the
                    process of calculating loss, conducting backpropagation through calculating derivatives of each
                    weight, and finally
                    testing this new method on a few datasets. In the video, the red dots are predictions from the
                    trained model and the
                    blue dots are the true values (they are extremely close so it looks like it's glitching sometimes).

                <div class="project-card-desc">Original idea based on the two-player game “Bomberman” by Nintendo. The
                    bulk of the project was developing a custom map
                    generator. It was partly based on Sebastian Lague's “Cave Generation” series and the theory of
                    Cellular Automata. The
                    game never got far though because this was during AP testing season and later I got more interested
                    in other projects.
